Study Drills questions:
1) Please make these changes in chapter_3/ex3.rb
1.Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
> Done.

2.Remember in Exercise 0 when you started Ruby? Start Ruby this way again and using the math operators,
use Ruby as a calculator.
> Okay.

3.Find something you need to calculate and write a new .rb file that does it.
> D_and_D_Transportation.rb

4.Notice the math seems "wrong"?
There are no fractions, only whole numbers.
You need to use a "floating point" number, which is a number with a decimal point, as in 10.5, or 0.89, or even 3.0.
5.Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate.
20.0 is floating point.

> Okay.

2) Create a new file called irb_calculator.md.
Run 'irb' in your console, do some calculator stuff and then copy/paste your screen into irb_calculator.md.
Bonus points for using markdown syntax(1) to make it look good.

> Done.

3) Create a new Ruby file for this one

> Nope :P

4) Add your research to Readme.md

> Done.

5) Copy ex3.rb to ex3_floating.rb for this one.

> okay ;)
